** Performance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: performance
   :END:

- Latency (time start \( \rightarrow \) done)
- Throughput (#/second) (not necessarily 1/latency due to pipelining)

*** Comparing Performance
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: comparing-performance
    :END:
"X is N times faster than Y"

Speedup: N = Speed(X) / Speed(Y) = Throughput(X) / Throughput(Y) = Latency(Y) / Latency(X)
*Note the difference when using Latency

*** Speedup
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: speedup
    :END:
Speedup > 1: Improved Performance * Shorter execution
time * Higher throughput

Speedup < 1:  Worse Performance

Performance ∝ Throughput

Performance ∝ 1/Latency

** Measuring Performance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: measuring-performance
   :END:
How do we measure performance?

Actual User Workload: * Many programs * Not representative of other
users * How do we get workload data?

Instead, use Benchmarks

*** Benchmarks
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: benchmarks
    :END:
Programs and input data agreed upon for performance measurements.
Typically there is a benchmark suite, comprised of multiple programs,
each representative of some kind of application.

**** Benchmark Types
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: benchmark-types
     :END:

- Real Applications

  - Most Representative
  - Most difficult to set up
  - Used for real machine comparisons

- Kernels

  - Find most time-consuming part of application
  - May not be easy to run depending on development phase
  - Best to run once a prototype machine is available

- Synthetic Benchmarks

  - Behave similarly to kernels but simpler to compile
  - Typically good for design studies to choose from design

- Peak Performance

  - In theory, how many IPS
  - Typically only good for marketing

**** Benchmark Standards
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: benchmark-standards
     :END:
A benchmarking organization takes input from academia, user groups, and
manufacturers, and curates a standard benchmark suite. Examples: TPC
(databases, web), EEMBC (embedded), SPEC (engineering workstations, raw
processors). For example, SPEC includes GCC, Perl, BZIP, and more.

*** Summarizing Performance
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: summarizing-performance
    :END:
**** Average Execution Time
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: average-execution-time
     :END:
|       | Comp X | Comp Y | Speedup |
|-------+--------+--------+---------|
| App A | 9s     | 18s    | 2.0     |
| App B | 10s    | 7s     | 0.7     |
| App C | 5s     | 11s    | 2.2     |
| AVG   | 8s     | 12s    | 1.5     |

If you simply average speedups, you get 1.63 instead. Speedup of average
execution times is not the same as simply averaging speedups on
individual applications.

**** Geometric Mean
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: geometric-mean
     :END:
If we want to be able to average speedups, we need to use geometric
means for both average times and speedups. This results in the same
value whether you are taking the geometric mean of individual speedups,
or speedup of geometric mean of execution times.

For example, in the table above we would obtain:
|                | Comp X              | Comp Y                | Speedup |
|----------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------|
| App A          | 9s                  | 18s                   |     2.0 |
| App B          | 10s                 | 7s                    |     0.7 |
| App C          | 5s                  | 11s                   |     2.2 |
| AVG            | 8s                  | 12s                   |     1.5 |
| Geometric Mean | (9x10x5)^1/3 = 7.66 | (18x7x11)^1/3 = 11.15 | 11.15/7.66 = 1.456 ~ (2x0.7x2.2)^1/3 = 1.454 |

Geometric mean of speedup values (2.0, 0.7, 2.2) also result in 1.456.

Geometric mean = (Product of the terms)^ (1/Number of terms)

As a general rule, if you are trying to average things that are ratios
(speedups are ratios), you cannot simply average them. Use the geometric
mean instead.

** Iron Law of Performance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: iron-law-of-performance
   :END:
*CPU Time* = (# instructions in the program) * (cycles per instruction) *  (clock cycle time)

All three aspects are important in decision making in computer architecture
● # of Instructions in the Program: is effected by the algorithm, the compiler used, and/or the instruction set used.
● Cycles per Instructions: is affected by the instruction set and/or the processor design
● Clock cycle Time: is affected by processor design, circuit design, and/or transistor
physics
● Computer architects influence the instruction set and the processor design.

* Transistor Physics

*** Iron Law for Unequal Instruction Times
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: iron-law-for-unequal-instruction-times
    :END:
When instructions have different number of cycles, sum them
individually:

CPU Time = [Sum of(Inst/Program * cycles/Inst)] * Time/cycle

** Amdahl's Law
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: amdahls-law
   :END:
Used when only part of the program or certain instructions. What is the
overall affect on speedup?

Speedup = 1/((1­Frac of Enhancement) + (Frac Enhancement/Speedup Enhancement))

where =Frac of Enhancement= represents the fraction of the execution *TIME*
enhanced by the changes, and =Speedup Enhancement= represents the amount
that change was sped up.

=Frac of Enhancement = % of original execution time that is affected by enhancement=.

NOTE: Always ensure the fraction represents TIME, not any other quantity
(cycles, etc.). First, convert changes into execution time before the
change, and execution time after the change.

*** Implications
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: implications
    :END:
Compare these enhancements: * Enhancement 1 * Speedup of 20x on 10% of
time * \( \Rightarrow \) speedup = 1.105 * Enhancement 2 * Speedup of
1.6x on 80% of time * \( \Rightarrow \) speedup = 1.43

Even an infinite speedup in enhancement 1 only yields 1.111 overall
speedup.

~Takeaway: Make the common case fast~

*** Lhadma's Law
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: lhadmas-law
    :END:

- Amdahl: Make common case fast
- Lhadma: Do not mess up the uncommon case too badly

Example: * Improvement of 2x on 90% * Slow down rest by 10x * Speedup =
\( \frac{1}{\frac{0.1}{0.1} + \frac{0.9}{2}} = \frac{1}{1+0.45} = 0.7 \)
* \( \Rightarrow \) Net slowdown, not speedup.

*** Diminishing Returns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: diminishing-returns
    :END:
Consequence of Amdahl's law. If you keep trying to improve the same
area, you get diminishing returns on the effort. Always reconsider what
is now the dominant part of the execution time.
