** Computer Architecture
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: computer-architecture
   :END:
*** What is it?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: what-is-it
    :END:
Architecture - design a /building/ that is well-suited for its purpose\\
Computer Architecture - design a /computer/ that is well-suited for its
purpose.

*** Why do we need it?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: why-do-we-need-it
    :END:

1. Improve Performance (e.g.Â speed, battery life, size, weight, energy
   effficiency, ...)
2. Improve Abilities (3D graphics, debugging support, security, ...)

Takeaway: Computer Architecture takes available hardware (fabrication,
circuit designs) to create faster, lighter, cheaper, etc. computers.

** Technology Trends
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: technology-trends
   :END:
If you design given current technology/parts, you get an obsolete
computer by the time the design is complete. Must take into account
technological trends and anticipate future technology

*** Moore's Law
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: moores-law
    :END:
Used to predict technology trends. Every 18-24 months, you get 2x
transistors for same chip area:\\
\( \Rightarrow \) Processor speed doubles\\
\( \Rightarrow \) Energy/Operation cut in half\\
\( \Rightarrow \) Memory capacity doubles

*** Memory Wall
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: memory-wall
    :END:
Consequence of Moore's Law. IPS and Capacity double every 2 years. If
Latency only improves 1.1x every two years, there is a gap between
latency and speed/capacity, called the Memory Wall. Caches are used to
fill in this gap.

** Processor Speed, Cost, Power
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: processor-speed-cost-power
   :END:
|    | Speed | Cost | Power |
|----+-------+------+-------|
|    | 2x    | 1x   | 1x    |
| OR | 1.1x  | .5x  | .5x   |

Improvements may differ, it's not always speed. Which one of the above
do you really want? It depends.

** Power Consumption
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: power-consumption
   :END:
Two kinds of power a processor consumes. 1. Dynamic Power - consumed by
activity in a circuit 2. Static Power - consumed when powered on, but
idle

*** Active Power
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: active-power
    :END:
Can be computed by

\[P = \tfrac 12 \*C\*V^2\*f\*\alpha\] Where
\[\\\\C = \text{capacitance}\\\\P = \text{power supply voltage}\\\\f = \text{frequency} \\\\ \alpha = \text{activity factor (some percentage of transistors active each clock cycle)}\]

For example, if we cut size/capacitance in half but put two cores on a
chip, the active power is relatively unchanged. To get power
improvements, you really need to lower the voltage.

*** Static Power
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: static-power
    :END:
The power it takes to maintain the circuits when not in use.
[[https://i.imgur.com/Db7NwSj.png]] Decreasing the voltage means the
reduced electrical "pressure" on a transistor results in more static
power usage. However, increasing the voltage means you consume more
active power. There is a minimum at which total power (static + dynamic)
occurs.

** Fabrication Cost and Yield
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fabrication-cost-and-yield
   :END:
Circuits are printed onto a wafer in silicon, divided up into small
chips, and packaged. The packaged chip is tested and either discarded or
shipped/sold. Larger chips could have more fallout due to probabilities
of using larger areas of the wafer, and thus cost more.

\[ \text{fabrication yield} =  \tfrac{\text{working chips}}{\text{chips on wafer}} \]

#+caption: Fabrication Yield

Fabrication cost example: If a wafer costs $5000, and has approximately
10 defects, how much does each chip cost in the following example?
Remember \( \text{chip cost} =
\tfrac{\text{wafer cost}}{\text{fabrication yield} } \)

| Size  | Chips/Wafer | Yield | Cost    |
|-------+-------------+-------+---------|
| Small | 400         | 390   | $12.80  |
| Large | 96          | 86    | $58.20  |
| Huge  | 20          | 11    | $454.55 |

Benefit from Moore's Law in two ways: * Smaller \( \Rightarrow \) much
lower cost * Same Area \( \Rightarrow \) faster for same cost

*[IPS]: Instructions per Second
