Given a certain latency, the idea is that the first unit of work is
achieved in the same period of time, but successive units continue to be
completed thereafter. (Oil pipeline vs.Â traveling with a bucket)

** Pipelining in a Processor
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pipelining-in-a-processor
   :END:
Each logical phase of operation in the processor (fetch, decode, ALU,
memory, write) operates as a pipeline in which successive instructions
move through each phase immediately behind the current instruction,
instead of waiting for the entire instruction to complete.

** Pipeline CPI
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pipeline-cpi
   :END:
Is Pipeline CPI = always 1?

On initial fill, CPI \( \rightarrow \) 1 when # instruction \(
\rightarrow \infty \). If pipeline stalls (a single phase breaks down),
then on the next cycle the successive phase will be doing no work.
Therefore, CPI is always > 1 if any stalls are possible. For example, if
every 5 cycles one phase stalls, your CPI is 6 cycles/5 units = 1.2 CPI.

** Processor Pipeline Stalls
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: processor-pipeline-stalls
   :END:
In the example below, we see one example of a pipeline stall in a
processor in a program like this:

#+begin_example
  LW  R1, ...
  ADD R2, R1, 1
  ADD R3, R2, 1
#+end_example

#+caption: Processor Pipeline Stalls
[[https://i.imgur.com/E21sE3o.png]]

The second instruction depends on the result of the first instruction,
and must wait for it to complete the ALU and MEM phases before it can
proceed. Thus, the CPI is actually much greater than 1.

** Processor Pipeline Stalls and Flushes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: processor-pipeline-stalls-and-flushes
   :END:
#+begin_example
  LW  R1, ...
  ADD R2, R1, 1
  ADD R3, R2, 1
  JUMP ...
  SUB ... ...
  ADD ... ...
  SHIFT
#+end_example

In this case, we have a jump, but we don't know where yet (maybe the
address is being manipulated by previous instructions). Instructions
following the jump instruction are loaded into the pipeline. When we get
to the ALU phase, the =JUMP= will be processed, but this means the next
instruction is not the =SUB ... ...= or =ADD ... ...=. These
instructions are then flushed from the pipeline and the correct
instruction (=SHIFT=) is fetched.

** Control Dependencies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: control-dependencies
   :END:
For the following program, the =ADD=/=SUB= instructions have a control
dependence on =BEQ=. Similarly, the instructions after =label:= also
have a control dependence on =BEQ=.

#+begin_example
      ADD R1, R1, R2
      BEQ R1, R3, label
      ADD R2, R3, R4
      SUB R5, R6, R8
  label:
      MUL R5, R6, R8
#+end_example

We estimate that: - 20% of instructions are branch/jump - slightly more
than 50% of all branch/jump instructions are taken

On a 5-stage pipeline, CPI = 1 + 0.1/2 = 1.2 (10% of the time (50% /
20%) an instruction spends two extra cycles)

With a deeper pipeline (more stages), the number of wasted instructions
increases.

** Data Dependencies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: data-dependencies
   :END:
#+begin_example
      ADD R1, R2, R3
      SUB R7, R1, R8
      MUL R1, R5, R6
#+end_example

This program has 3 dependencies:

1. Lines 1 and 2 have a RAW (Read-After-Write) dependence on R1 (also
   called Flow dependence, or TRUE dependence). The =ADD= instruction
   must be completed before the =SUB= instruction.

2. Lines 1 and 3 have a WAW (Write-After-Write) dependence on R1 with
   the =MUL= instruction in which the =ADD= must complete first, else R1
   is overwritten with an incorrect value. This is also called an Output
   dependence.

3. Lines 2 and 3 have a WAR (Write-After-Read) dependence on R1 in that
   the =SUB= instruction must use the value of R1 before the =MUL=
   instruction overwrites it. This is also called an Anti-dependence
   because it reverses the order of the flow dependence.

WAW and WAR dependencies are also called "False" or "Name" dependencies.
RAR (Read-After-Read) dependencies do not matter since the value could
not have changed in-between and is thus safe to read.

*** Data Dependencies Quiz
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: data-dependencies-quiz
    :END:
(Included for additional study help). For the following program, select
which dependencies exist:

#+begin_example
      MUL R1, R2, R3
      ADD R4, R4, R1
      MUL R1, R5, R6
      SUB R4, R4, R1
#+end_example

|                         | RAW | WAR | WAW |
|-------------------------+-----+-----+-----|
| \( I1 \rightarrow I2 \) | x   | -   | -   |
| \( I1 \rightarrow I3 \) | -   | -   | x   |
| \( I1 \rightarrow I4 \) | -   | -   | -   |
| \( I2 \rightarrow I3 \) | -   | x   | -   |

** Dependencies and Hazards
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dependencies-and-hazards
   :END:
Dependence - property of the program alone.

Hazard - when a dependence results in incorrect execution.

For example, in a 5-stage pipeline, a dependency that is 3 instructions
apart may not cause a hazard, since the result will be written before
the dependent instruction reads it.

** Handling of Hazards
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: handling-of-hazards
   :END:
First, detect hazard situations. Then, address it by: 1. Flush dependent
instructions 2. Stall dependent instruction 3. Fix values read by
dependent instructions

Must use flushes for control dependencies, because the instructions that
come after the hazard are the wrong instructions.

For data dependence, we can stall the next instruction, or fix the
instruction by forwarding the value to the correct stage of the pipeline
(e.g.Â "keep" the value inside the ALU stage for the next instruction to
use). Forwarding does not always work, because the value we need is
produced at a later point in time. In this cases we must stall.

** How Many Stages?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-many-stages
   :END:
For an ideal CPI = 1, we consider the following:

More Stages \( \rightarrow \) more hazards (CPI \( \uparrow \)), but
less work per stage ( cycle time \( \downarrow \))

From iron law, Execution Time = # Instructions * CPI * Cycle Time

# Stages should be chosen to balance CPI and Cycle time (some local
minima for execution time where cycle time has decreased without causing
additional hazards). Additionally consider more stages consumes more
power (work being done in less cycle time with more latches per stage).

- Performance (execution time) \( \Rightarrow \) 30-40 stages
- Manageable Power Consumption \( \Rightarrow \) 10-15 stages
